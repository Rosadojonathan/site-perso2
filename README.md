This project is my personal website. I experiment with all sorts of web technologies and it serves as a resume/portfolio. I just find it a great tool for learning  and you may find that some of the tech stack choices are overkill for what I actually do with them but that's okay :) 

It has CMS-like features and a machine learning powered chatbot. 

## Tech Stack

Front End: React & Redux for some state management
Back-End: Express, Sequelize
DataBases: Postgres, Firebase & MongoDB (just for fun)
Machine Learning: Python Chatbot with RASA Core
Continuous Integration & Deployment: Docker (for the chatbot only)
Webserver: Nginx

### Plans for the future

- I plan to add an interface to take over chatbot conversations and respond directly from the admin pages.
- Once I have written many more articles it'd be cool to add a content based Recommender System.
