This project is the full stack development of my personal website. I experiment with all sorts of web technologies and it serves as a resume/portfolio. I just find it a great learning project so you may find that some of the tech stack choices are a bit overkill for what I actually do with them but that's okay :) 

It has CMS-like features and a machine learning powered chatbot. 

## Tech Stack

- Front End: React & Redux for some auth state management
- Back-End: Express, Sequelize
- DataBases: Postgres, Firebase & MongoDB (just for fun)
- Machine Learning: Python Chatbot with RASA Core
- Deployment: Docker (for the chatbot only)
- Webserver: Nginx
- Hosting: VPS Digital Ocean

### Plans for the future

- Add GraphQL because it's cool?
- Add an interface to take over chatbot conversations and respond directly from the admin pages.
- Add a content based Recommender System once I have written more articles.
